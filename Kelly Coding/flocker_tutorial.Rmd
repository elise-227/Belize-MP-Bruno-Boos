```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

flocker is an R package for fitting occupacy models

```{r}

# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jsocolar/flocker")

install.packages("cmdstanr", repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/", getOption("repos")))

cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()

```











## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
